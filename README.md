### Code Journal
- This is the second assignment in JS. I feel a little more comfortable than last one. 
- To write a JS code , I need to declare a variable first. Then I can print this with console.log. I can find this in console in browser(F12).
- If I want to add a label to the console message, I can use ``` console.log('.....',variable);``` .
- If ``` console.log(Number++) ```, the number shows in console will be the original number. if ``` console.log(++Number)```, the number shows in console will be the original number plus 1.
